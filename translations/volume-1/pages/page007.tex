Thus, the importance and need for comprehensive presentation of widely branched knowledge was naturally accompanied by the necessity of uniting their representatives for collaborative work.

At the Natural Scientists' Meeting in Vienna in September 1894, the German Mathematical Association decided to adopt the plan of composing a dictionary of pure and applied mathematics and commissioned Franz Meyer to seek scientific and financial support from the academies and learned societies of Göttingen, Leipzig, Munich, and Vienna united in the Cartel.

At the beginning of 1895, the first draft of the book, combined with a preliminary financing plan (which was established with the involvement of B. G. Teubner in Leipzig) was presented to the academies and received principal approval from Göttingen, Munich, and Vienna, while the Society of Sciences in Leipzig, due to lack of available funds, found itself compelled to abstain from participation in the enterprise for the time being.

The learned societies commissioned F. Klein (Göttingen), W. v. Dyck (Munich), G. v. Escherich (Vienna) to initiate discussions with the editorial board and with a publisher to be considered, and to draft a detailed plan of the enterprise regarding both its scientific and financial aspects. This academic commission subsequently stood as a permanent institution alongside the editorial board. It strengthened itself right at the beginning through H. Weber (Strasbourg) as representative of the German Mathematical Association and L. Boltzmann (Vienna) as advisor in scientific matters. Later, H. v. Seeliger (Munich) and more recently O. Hölder (Leipzig), who will be mentioned later, joined as well.
