Thus may the Encyclopedia under this friendly aspect, under the protection of the united Academies, serve the sciences in its part:

Pure mathematical research, by preparing the old furrowed ground for new sowing and harvest, and opening up conquered land to fertilizing intellectual work;

The applied branches of knowledge, by bringing together the often separated paths of mathematical and scientific consideration, and preparing the foundation and method for their further development;

The totality of all intellectual work, by designating and circumscribing the position that belongs to the mathematical sciences in the realm of human knowledge.
