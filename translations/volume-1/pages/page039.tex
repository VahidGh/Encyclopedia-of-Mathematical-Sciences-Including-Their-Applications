\textbf{1. Counting and Numbers.} \textit{Counting} things\textsuperscript{1)} means viewing them as similar\textsuperscript{2)}, comprehending them together, and to them individually other things

1) That \textit{non-physical} things can also be counted was emphasized by \textit{G. F. Leibniz} against the Scholastics in "De arte combinatoria" (1666), as well as by \textit{J. Locke} in his work "An Essay concerning human understanding" (1690, Book II). In contrast, \textit{J. St. Mill} (Logic, Book III, 26) sees the fact stated in the definition of a number as \textit{physical}, similar to \textit{G. Frege} in "Foundations of Arithmetic" (Breslau 1884).

2) \textit{E. Schr√∂der} in his "Textbook of Arithmetic" (Leipzig 1878) p. 4 emphasizes that the counting process must be preceded by both a combining of the things to be counted and the recognition of the similarity of the things to be counted, as does \textit{E. Mach} in his book "The Principles of Heat Theory" (Leipzig 1896) (No. 7).
