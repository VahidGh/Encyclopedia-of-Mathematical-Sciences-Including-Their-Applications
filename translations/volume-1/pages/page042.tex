represented the numbers from one to nineteen through combinations of individual circles. Modern civilized peoples still have natural symbols only on dice, dominoes, and playing cards. If one assigns similar sounds to the things to be counted, one obtains the natural number sounds, as heard, for example, from the chimes of clocks. Instead of such natural number symbols and number sounds, one usually uses symbols and words that are methodically composed of a few elementary symbols and word stems\textsuperscript{7)}. The modern numeral writing, which is based on the principle of place value and the introduction of a symbol for nothing, was invented by Indian Brahma priests, became known to the Arabs around 800 and reached Christian Europe around 1200, where over the course of the following centuries the new numeral writing and new calculation gradually displaced calculation with Roman numerals\textsuperscript{7)}. 

The study of relationships between numbers is called \textit{arithmetic} ($\alpha\rho\iota\theta\mu\acute{o}\varsigma$ = number). \textit{Calculation} means methodically deriving sought numbers from given numbers. In arithmetic, it is customary to express any number through a \textit{letter}, whereby it must only be noted that within one and the same consideration
