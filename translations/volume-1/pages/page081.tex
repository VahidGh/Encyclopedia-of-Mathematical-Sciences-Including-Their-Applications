\textbf{27. Recurrent Determinants. Circulants.} The symmetry appears in \textit{recurrent} D. $a_{ik}=a_{i+k-2}$ in even stronger measure. \textit{Hankel} (l. c.), who designates them as orthosymmetric, represents them as $|\Delta_k|$, where the $\Delta_k$ are the initial terms of the difference series of $a_{i+k}$. These D. appear frequently in algebra\textsuperscript{101)}; their rank becomes thereby of importance.

A special case of this form those recurrent D. of $n$th degree, where $a_{n+i}=a_i$\textsuperscript{102)}; and with these closely connected are the \textit{circulants} (cf. Nr. 16) ($a_{ik}=a_{i+1,k+1}$), which are symmetric in relation to the secondary diagonal, which can be transformed into those through exchange of R. A circulant can be decomposed into the product of the $n$ factors 

\vspace{-0.1cm}
\begin{center}
    $ a_1 + \omega^\alpha a_2 + \omega^{2\alpha} a_3 + ... + \omega^{(n-1)\alpha} a_n$ ,\quad $(\alpha=1,2,...n)$, 
\end{center}

where $\omega$ means a primitive $n$th root of unity; from this follows immediately that a circulant of $2n$th degree can be represented as one of $n$th degree\textsuperscript{103)}. A circulant of $2n$ degree can further be expressed as product of one of $n$th degree and a similarly formed one\textsuperscript{104)}.

\textbf{28. Half-symmetric Determinants.} For \textit{half-symmetric} D.\textsuperscript{105)} ($a_{ik}=-a_{ki}$, $a_{ii}=0$) the following theorems hold: $A_{ik}=A_{ki}$; $D=0$ for odd $n$; on the other hand $a'_{ik}=-a'_{ki}; \frac{\partial D}{\partial a_{ik}}=0; D=0$; is a square for even $n$. Every term of $\sqrt{D}$ is a product of $\frac{1}{2}n$ El. $a_{ik}$, whose indices are all different from each other, as e.g. the term appearing in $\sqrt{D}$ shows $a_{12} a_{34} ... a_{n-1,n}$. $\sqrt{D}$ is set by \textit{Cayley} (l. c.) $=\pm(1,2,...n)$ and designated as "Pfaffian".
