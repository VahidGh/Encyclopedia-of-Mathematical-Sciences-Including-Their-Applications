joined one of the purely \textit{arithmetic} forms of definition of irrational numbers and thus agree to a \textit{separation} of \textit{pure number theory} from the \textit{actual theory of magnitude}\textsuperscript{38)}. The introduction of that \textit{axiom} becomes necessary with this view only when it is a matter of transferring the results validly existing within pure \textit{arithmetic} without its participation into \textit{spatial intuition}\textsuperscript{39)}.

\textbf{8. Perfect Arithmetization in Kronecker's Sense.} While the adherents of the just described \textit{"arithmetizing"} direction content themselves with basing the \textit{definition} of \textit{irrational numbers} and the arithmetic operations to be performed with them on the theory of \textit{rational}, thus ultimately of \textit{whole} numbers, \textit{Kronecker} has set forth a substantially higher degree of \textit{"arithmetization"} of the entire number theory (arithmetic, analysis, algebra) as a desirable and, in his opinion, also attainable goal\textsuperscript{40)}. According to this, the arithmetic disciplines should \textit{"strip off again all modifications and extensions of the concept of number} (except that of the natural number)"; in particular, therefore, \textit{irrational numbers} should be definitively banished from them. That it will ever come to that does not seem very likely to me\textsuperscript{41)}. For if one observes what \textit{Kronecker} proposes l.c. for the elimination of \textit{negative} and \textit{fractional}\textsuperscript{42)}, as well as \textit{algebraic} numbers, one gets the impression that the \textit{perfect arithmetization} of those disciplines in question would amount to \textit{dissolving} their well-tested mode of expression and symbolic language, which \textit{summarizes} extremely \textit{complicated} relations between \textit{natural} numbers in the shortest and completely precise manner, into a most extensive and cumbersome formalism.
