The so-called \textit{infinitely small} behaves somewhat differently. If $\lim a_\nu = 0$, one often uses the \textit{expression}: the numbers $a_\nu$ \textit{become} \textit{infinitely small} with \textit{unboundedly} increasing values of $\nu$\textsuperscript{110)}. Wherever in \textit{arithmetic}, \textit{function theory}, \textit{geometry} the so-called \textit{infinitely small} appears, it is always only a \textit{becoming infinitely small}, thus according to the terminology used above an \textit{improperly-infinitely small}\textsuperscript{111)}. Although it has recently been possible to establish self-consistent systems of \textit{properly-infinitely small "magnitudes"}\textsuperscript{112)}, these are merely \textit{systems of symbols} with \textit{purely formally} defined laws, which partly differ from those valid for real numbers. Such fictitious \textit{properly-infinitely small magnitudes} have no direct relation to \textit{real numbers}; they find no place in proper \textit{arithmetic} and \textit{analysis} and cannot, like real numbers, serve to \textit{describe} \textit{geometric magnitude} relations without contradiction. In particular, from the possibility of such arithmetic constructions, the \textit{existence of infinitely small geometric magnitudes} (e.g., line elements) \textit{cannot} be inferred. \textit{G. Cantor} has rather explicitly shown that from the assumption of numbers that are numerically \textit{smaller} than \textit{any} positive number, precisely the \textit{non-existence of infinitely small line segments} can be inferred\textsuperscript{113)}.

so one has for \textit{every arbitrarily large} finite $x$ without exception:

$$f(x) = 1,$$

whereas: 

\vspace{-0.4cm}
$$f_n(\infty) = 0, \quad thus \; also: \quad f(\infty) = 0.$$

In general, the behavior of a function $f(x)$ for that \textit{value} or \textit{point} $x = \infty$ is defined by that of $f(\frac{1}{x})$ for $x = 0$. Cf. II B 1. Another type of the properly-infinite ("the infinitely distant line") has proven expedient in projective \textit{geometry}.

111) With the \textit{properly-infinite} $x = \infty$ of function theory corresponds \textit{not} a \textit{properly-infinitely} small value $x$, but the value $x = 0$.
