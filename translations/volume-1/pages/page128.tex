If one chooses, as happens with the criteria exclusively applied in practice, the $D_\nu$, $C_\nu$ \textit{monotonically} increasing\textsuperscript{197)}, their applicability obviously extends only to such $a_\nu$ which either directly decrease \textit{monotonically} or at least \textit{"essentially" monotonically}, i.e., so that any fluctuations remain within certain bounds.

\textbf{30. The Boundary Regions of Divergence and Convergence.} The first example of a \textit{convergent} series for which the ordinary logarithmic (\textit{Bonnet}) scale \textit{fails} according to the mode of Eq. (A) was constructed by \textit{Du Bois-Reymond}\textsuperscript{198)}. I have then given a somewhat more general series type with a more transparent formation law, which simultaneously also provides \textit{divergent} series of the nature in question\textsuperscript{199)}. The method used here can, as \textit{Hadamard} has shown\textsuperscript{200)}, easily be transferred to any \textit{arbitrary} criterion scale.

But there are also infinitely many \textit{monotonic} $a_\nu$ for which an arbitrarily chosen criterion scale must completely fail in the sense of equations (B). The investigations I have undertaken in this direction\textsuperscript{201)} lead to the following general theorem: "However strongly $\sum C_\nu^{-1}$ may \textit{converge}, there always exist monotonic \textit{divergent} series $\sum a_\nu$ for which: $\underline{\lim} C_\nu a_\nu = 0$. However \textit{slowly} $m_\nu$ may grow to infinity with $\nu$, there always exist monotonic \textit{convergent} series $\sum a_\nu$ for which: $\overline{\lim} \, \nu \cdot m_\nu \cdot a_\nu = \infty$; on the other hand, one always has: $\lim \nu \cdot a_\nu = 0$." There exists therefore no $M_\nu$ of \textit{arbitrarily high infinity} such that $\lim M_\nu \cdot a_\nu > 0$ forms a \textit{necessary} condition for the \textit{divergence} of $\sum a_\nu$. On the other hand, the relation $\lim \nu \cdot a_\nu = 0$ does indeed form a \textit{necessary}\textsuperscript{202)}

202) That the same always \textit{suffices} for convergence was claimed by \textit{Th. Olivier} (J. f. Math. 2, 1827, p. 34), refuted by \textit{Abel} (l.c. 3, p. 79. Oeuvres 1, p. 399) by pointing to the series $\sum \frac{1}{\nu \lg \nu}$. \textit{Kummer} has, on the other hand, shown that that condition always suffices
